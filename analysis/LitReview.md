# Literature Review

- Source 1 uses an OLS model to find the relationship between vaccination rates and unemployment rates in the US. When analyzing domestic unemployment rates, they find a negative relationship between the two; an increase in vaccination rates is seen alongside a decrease in unemployment rates. However, when analyzing through a state-by-state view, they find that states with higher vaccination rates are more likely to have higher unemployment rates. Although this may seem counter-intuitive, the authors explain this by showing how states with higher vaccination rates experience a higher change in unemployment rates, indeed highlighting the benefits that higher vaccination rates have when it comes to unemplpyment. Indeed, source 3 also finds the same correlation between states with high unemployment rates and high vaccination rates.
- Source 1 also has controls for: college education and high school education.
- Source 2 finds that there is also a negative relationship between veccination and unemployment rates, specifically using instrumental variable analysis to isolate the effects of vaccines by using pharamacy desnity as a proxy.
- It is shown that a 5 percentage point increase in unemployment rate, a characteristic increase during a recessionary period, decreases the likelihood of a flu shot by 2.3 percentage points. (Source 4)
- Source 5 finds employs a hierarchical model to build a model around unemplpyment rates. Their analysis shows that a time series model given in Remark 1 for an individual state cannot be fit, as there are too many parameters relative to the data. Thus it is crucial to combine both the cross-sectional and time series data to develop improved estimates of the state unemployment rates.
- Vaccination rates in Nigeria:  Studies have reported that the Negative Binomial model has the best performance of count models for count health outcomes, and by extension, the Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial model in the presence of overdispersion and excess zeros and high variability â€“ one of which is vaccine uptake among Children in Nigeria. (Source 6)
- Bayes model to estimate effect of vaccine misinformation on vaccine intent.

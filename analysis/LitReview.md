# Literature Review

- Source 1 uses an OLS model to find the relationship between vaccination rates and unemployment rates in the US. When analyzing domestic unemployment rates, they find a negative relationship between the two; an increase in vaccination rates is seen alongside a decrease in unemployment rates. However, when analyzing through a state-by-state view, they find that states with higher vaccination rates are more likely to have higher unemployment rates. Although this may seem counter-intuitive, the authors explain this by showing how states with higher vaccination rates experience a higher change in unemployment rates, indeed highlighting the benefits that higher vaccination rates have when it comes to unemplpyment.
- Source 1 also has controls for: college education and high school education.
- Source 2 finds that there is also a negative relationship between veccination and unemployment rates, specifically using instrumental variable analysis to isolate the effects of vaccines by using pharamacy desnity as a proxy.
